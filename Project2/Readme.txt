      (iii)The pictures named qq_plot_multiple and scatter_residuals_multiple are for 		Task 3.3(a) and 3.3(b) respectively.
4)The homework is solved using Matlab and each folder contains the code for each tasks.
   So, you can run each file separately to check the results.
5) There is also a Matlab file named IOT_Project2.m which contains the full program for all three tasks divided in terms for section. You can run this code section wise to get the same result as given by individual programs in their respected folders.
6) This folder also contains the data given by the professor for the data analysis.
